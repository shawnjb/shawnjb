# Discord Server Rules

Some of these rules may be dismissed due to speech limitations, because people need to be able to express themselves & their concerns to get a point across. With limitations to speech, it makes things a little more difficult.

These rules are in place not to limit your speech, but to help others understand in a manner that is polite.

## General Rules

These rules apply to all text channels.

* [**Impersonation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impersonator) is not allowed. If you believe someone is impersonating another user, verify that their Discord ID matches the user that they are trying to impersonate.

* Do not discriminate, bully or harass anyone.

* Do not post NSFW or otherwise graphic imagery that some may find concerning or disheartening.

* Do not spam messages or otherwise create a wall of text to obstruct the view of readers.

* [**Do not disclose personally identifiable information.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)

* Political discussion is restricted.

* Innapropriate account usernames & profile pictures will result in punishment.

## Dealing with Rule Breakers

Someone causing trouble? To deal with a rule breaker; you should not interact with them, no matter what they say or do.

Actions can be forgiven, and users should be treated with respect. You are to care and love your fellow server members.

Repeated offenses will result in an unfortunate ban. We wish we could've had you around but you were probably being too disruptive.
