I'm a pretty good Lua programmer.

```lua
return {
    name = "Shawn Bragdon",
    birthdate = os.time({ year = 2004, month = 11, day = 9, hour = 7, min = 46 }),
    contact = { discord = { id = 1020933580517548093 } } 
}
```

I'm always looking to expand my skills, give me a good reason to help you out! I'm looking for development opportunities.
